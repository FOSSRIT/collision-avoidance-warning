# collision-avoidance-warning

Civic Hackathon 2014, creating android collision detection demo


This project will be for Android 4.0+, licensed under GPLv3.

Our goal is a functional prototype that can demonstrate collision detection using android phones.

The eventual goal is to outfit drivers with androids loaded with our software.
